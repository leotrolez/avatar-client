-- special thanks for Shaday, who made these translations
--Dominique120 edits: I made some statements to sound more formal and appropriate as well as correcting a few words that were not translated. I also added a few notes for future translators to keep in mind.


locale = {
  name = "es",
  charset = "cp1252",
  languageName = "Español",

  translation = {}
}
